[Q1] If there are more than one output that is true from the Type Decode unit, then it meant that 
			we used more than one operation in a single instruction which is not possible.
[Q2] It means that the input is invalid or the input requires two operations to execute but that
			is not possible.
[Q3] Because there can't be more than one '1' in the input which has a result in the table. The only
			inputs that have an entry in the table are those who have only one '1' because
			of what I said in Q1 that if it is possible, then it means we used more than one operation 
			in a single instruction which is not possible.

[Q4]
Cycle 01
Reg1 = 0
Reg2 = 9
WriteReg = 00000

Cycle 02
Reg1 = 0
Reg2 = 10
WriteReg = 00000

Cycle 03
Reg1 = 0
Reg2 = 8
WriteReg = 00000

Cycle 04
Reg1 = 9
Reg2 = 10
WriteReg = 01010


Cycle 05
Reg1 = 11
Reg2 = 9
WriteReg = 01001

Cycle 06
Reg1 = 8
Reg2 = 10
WriteReg = 01010

Cycle 07
Reg1 = 12
Reg2 = 9
WriteReg = 01001

Cycle 08
Reg1 = 12
Reg2 = 13
WriteReg = 01101

Cycle 09
Reg1 = 10
Reg2 = 8
WriteReg = 01000

[Q5] 
WriteReg = 01000
WriteData = 
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
WriteData is blank since there is nothing to write, it's just comparing if it's equal or not.
