### Weknowtes
Weknowtes hopes to make UP Cebu better by providing a centralized virtual classroom focused on note-sharing.

## You can create classrooms and add members!
A classroom can be a subject or a course that you can add your classmates and friends into. You can then post in the forum of the classroom - ask when is the deadline of your projects, post some notes, ask for some notes, etc.

## You can create topics in your classrooms
To manage your work in the classroom, you can add specific topics in which each of them has a forum.

## Centralized note sharing
Members of the classroom can now share their thoughts about the subjects and the notes and files they had in the lectures. By the time an exam is coming up, you can just browse through the posts and find the files/reviewers you are looking for.

## Friendly for students, teachers, and staff alike
Weknowtes isn't just for students only. The staff can also upload their files in there - memos, proposals, etc. and share them with the members of their own classroom.
